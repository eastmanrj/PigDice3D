I uploaded several screenshots of my game to this repository.  I included both the French and English versions.  For the French, I used Google Translate as well as my own imperfect knowledge of the language.

I hopefully you can examine it and recommend changes so that it doesn't look like a foreigner (moi) did it.

Here are some specific problems that I am having:

* In general, French has more letters of course, so I was forced to abbreviate the word "ordinateur" to "ord.", which I don't like.  Maybe you know of a better way to do this.
* For "Fewest Rolls" and "Most Rolls", I used "Rouleaux +" and "Rouleaux -" because the French was too long.
* Are the words "lancer" and "rouler" interchangeable?  Should I choose just one or use both?
* I know that the French quotes << and >> should go right next to the words instead of having a space between them.  I need to fix that.
* Is Depot the right word to use for Bank?  It seems right to me, but I am probably wrong.

  Thank you for your help!  Send me a text, an email, or create an issue right here on Github.  Let me know what I owe you, and I'll pay Jen.
